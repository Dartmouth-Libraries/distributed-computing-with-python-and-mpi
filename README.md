# Distributed computing with Python and MPI

An introduction into using MPI in the Python programming language to run complex computations on a cluster.

There are a number of examples:

- ``hello_world.py``: A most basic example
- ``blocking-send-and-receive.py``: An example to show a simple blocking send and receive
- ``ring-send-and-receive.py``: A slightly more advanced example of blocking send and receive
